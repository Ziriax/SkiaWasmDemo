## How to build

* Clone this repository
* Install Docker
* If on Windows:
  * open a command prompt 
    - use CMD.exe, Powershell is **not** tested!
  * run
    * `Skia\build`
    * `Demo\build`
    * `start Demo\serve`
      - run this just once, afterwards just refresh the webpage
* If not on Windows:
  * convert the batch files to `bash` and send me a PR :)

Have fun!
